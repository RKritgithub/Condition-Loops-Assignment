Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.

Answer:
Loops in JavaScript allow repetitive execution of a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. They are essential for tasks like iterating over arrays, performing repetitive calculations, and automating tasks.

1. **For Loop**  
   **Syntax:**  
   ```javascript
   for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
       // code to execute
   }
   ```

2. **While Loop**  
   **Syntax:**  
   ```javascript
   while (condition) {
       // code to execute
   }
   ```

3. **Do-While Loop**  
   **Syntax:**  
   ```javascript
   do {
       // code to execute
   } while (condition);
   ```
